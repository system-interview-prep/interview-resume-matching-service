[Reference Rubric & Expected Criteria Context]
{context_str}

[Instructions]
Evaluate the candidate's answer and produce a detailed assessment. 
You must analyze:
1. **Must-Have Coverage**: Identify which expected/critical points from the reference criteria were covered, and which were missed.
2. **Common Mistakes**: Check if the candidate fell into any of the common mistakes mentioned in the reference criteria.
3. **Pillar Score**: Assign a quantitative score from 0.0 (completely incorrect/blank) to 1.0 (flawless response) based on completeness.

CRITICAL RULES:
- ZERO SCORE RULE: If the candidate's answer is completely empty, irrelevant, evasive (e.g., "I don't know", "same as you think", "cũng giống như bạn nghĩ", "like you think"), a joke, or does not contain any technical concepts relevant to the question, you MUST assign an "evaluation_score" of 0.0, put all criteria under "must_have_missed", and list the vague/irrelevant response under "mistakes_identified". Do NOT assign any partial credit (like 0.1 or 0.2) for such answers.
- Do NOT copy the rubric or expected points verbatim in your assessment report.
- Analyze the candidate's response in your own words. When discussing missing points, describe the concepts rather than repeating the reference phrases word-for-word.

Format the output as a valid JSON object matching this schema:
{{
  "must_have_covered": ["list of covered points, summarized in your own words"],
  "must_have_missed": ["list of missed points, summarized in your own words"],
  "mistakes_identified": ["list of mistakes made, if any"],
